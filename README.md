## Hi, I'm Ayomide :alien:
I'm a front end web developer, at least I'm working towards becoming one lol.

#### I've worked with
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Materialize
* Bulma
* Firebase's Cloud Firestore

I'm currently learning React.js and parts of its ecosystem.

I listen to a ton of music, I watch anime and I game.ðŸŽ®<br />
Oh and I can learn anything, if you pay me, lol kidding, or am I?ðŸ‘€ <br />
I love and really look forward to working with groups of people.<br />
Feel free to hit me up anytime on my socials
